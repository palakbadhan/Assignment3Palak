    <p style="background-color: rgb(91, 116, 91);color: white;"><i><b><a id=" Why its my favorite one?">Why its my favorite one?</a></b></i><br> For as long as I can remember, my dad has cultivated a garden. I am more impressed with the garden — and with his generosity through<br> it — every year. I learned, from an early age, how gardening can improve health and our relationship with food, and how it can nourish neighborhood <br>and family communities with its abundance.</p>
    <dt><h2><a id="benefits" >Benefits of Gardening</a></h2></dt>   Gardening has been proven to have a lot of material benefits, as well as social ones, but it also provides a great number of physical benefits to gardeners of all ages.<hr>

    <dl><u>Taking Care of Plants Gives People a Purpose</u></dl><br><br>
 <dd>Growing plants can help give you a purpose in your life. Keeping your plants alive, encouraging them to set new leaves or to bloom profusely<br> or propagating them to share with friends and family are all great goals. Not only is gardening a healthy hobby , but it also gives you <br> to do in your spare time that’s productive.</dd><hr>

    The pure physical nature of gardening has you bending and stretching, lifting, digging and moving. It's a great way to exercise, burn calories<br> and it can be a great stress relief. Gardening in the sunshine, wearing a good sunscreen and a hat of course, fills your lungs with fresh<br> air and provides you with natural Vitamin D. <hr>

    <dd>Another rewarding aspects of gardening is the connection it fosters with the environment. Spending time outdoors allows me to appreciate<br> the beauty of nature. I find peace in the fresh air and the sound of rustling leaves. Furthermore, gardening teaches me to be mindful<br> and attentive. Each plant has its own requirements, and understanding these needs has enhanced my observation skills and ability to adapt.</dd><hr>
    <dt><h2><a id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2></dt>
    <dd>Gardening is one way to express our love, care, and nurture. Gardening is quite similar to watching and growing an infant. While gardening<br> one can imagine the life cycle of the plant starting from the embryo till the plant shoots up to bear fruits. Gardening gives us immense<br> pleasure and soothes our minds</p>
